# OcanPredict - Smart Web Based Application for Dental Disease Detection using Artificial Intelligence

## Overview
OcanPredict is a smart web-based application designed for early screening OSMF (Oral submucous fibrosis) which is a precancerous condition. It can also screen for various dental diseases using the power of Artificial Intelligence. It leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models and computer vision techniques to analyze real-time camera input and provide users with preliminary assessments of several oral health conditions. This tool aims to empower individuals with accessible and convenient preliminary screenings, promoting proactive dental care and early intervention. While not a replacement for professional diagnosis, OcanPredict can serve as an informative tool for raising awareness and encouraging timely consultations with dental professionals

Also It is multilingual supporting English, Hindi and Marathi for local adaptation.

## Technical Workflow

1. **User Interface Layer**
   - React components handle the UI rendering
   - TailwindCSS manages styling
   - Vite provides fast development and optimization

2. **ML Processing Layer**
   - TensorFlow.js loads and runs ML models
   - Face detection using MediaPipe
   - Real-time analysis and prediction

3. **Data Flow**
   - Camera input → Face Detection → Feature Extraction → Analysis → Results

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
